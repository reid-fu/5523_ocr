HANDWRITING RECOGNIZER
*Main Workflow*
- classification algorithm is neural network based on similarity to templates
# load and process templates, training sets, test sets
- see Image Processing Workflow
# initialize [[handwriting_recognizer_classifier][classifier]] with templates
# train classifier with training sets
# classify testing sets
# verify characters in each word using dictionary

*Image Processing Workflow*
- input: lines of text with no other images
# make image [[handwriting_recognizer_preproc][black and white]]
- convert image to grayscale
- threshold image to make it black and white
# decompose image into [[handwriting_recognizer_imgdecomp][line, word, and char hierarchy]]
- [[handwriting_recognizer_imgproc][separate]] lines by identifying row ranges of black pixels
- in each line, separate words and characters
-- identify all black and white pixel ranges
-- long white pixel ranges separate words
-- short white pixel ranges separate characters (may change later)
- normalize each char by cropping image to bounding box of char and resizing to standard size

*Possible Ideas*
- each pixel as feature, make matrix 28x28 == 784 features
