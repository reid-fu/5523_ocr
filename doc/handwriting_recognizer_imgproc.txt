HANDWRITING RECOGNIZER: ImgProcessor
- responsible for building ImgDecomp
*Methods*
- ImgDecomp processImg(Mat)
-- separate chars based on contours, isolate them in their bounding boxes (see boundRect)
-- categorize chars into separate lines (see separateLines)
-- get stats for spacing between chars
-- separate chars into words based on longer spacings

- List<Rect> boundRect(Mat)
-- call contours(Mat)
-- call Imgproc.boundingRect()
- List<MatOfPoint> contours(Mat)
-- call Imgproc.threshold()
-- call Mat.convertTo(Mat, 8UC1)
-- call Imgproc.findContours()

- Map<Range,List<Rect>> separateLines(List<Rect>)
-- get each Rect's vertical range
-- combine ranges that overlap
- Range overlapRangeInSet(Range, Set<Range>)
-- overlap means one range's start is between other's start and end
- Range rangeUnion(Range, Range)
